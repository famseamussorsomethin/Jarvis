A WIP AI LLM Chat-Bot that will eventually consistently complete good tool calls for commands on your computer to run. I made a mid one a week ago but im recoding it to be actually good. Currently I am setting up tool calls on it, and then optimizing it before I work on good system prompting for consistent tool calls and voice control.

## Requirements

- LM Studio Latest Version
- Any Qwen3 Model 
I use Qwen3-1.7b just because it is simple, fast, and still a reasoning model without being too dull-witted.

### Setup
- Run the LM Studio API Server and load the model with the api identifier "qwen3" (or change the one written in the code)
- Run main.py inside of the Jarvis folder.
- Have Fun! This will get more updates including hard-coded voice commands that do not use LLMs to complete the tool calls. I will try to improve this every day. Thank you for being apart of this project.

<small>the real challenge was using the word dull witted without sounding like a nerd</small>
